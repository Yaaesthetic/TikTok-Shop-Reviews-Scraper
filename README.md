2. **URL Filtering**: Only valid TikTok Shop domains are kept
3. **Web Scraping**: Playwright scrapes each URL with geo-spoofing
4. **Data Extraction**: BeautifulSoup extracts product and review data
5. **CSV Generation**: All data saved to structured CSV file

## Technical Implementation Details

### Content Scraping Challenges

**Single Page Application Architecture**
- TikTok Shop uses JavaScript-heavy frontend architecture
- Content loads dynamically after initial page response
- Requires browser automation for proper content access

**Regional Access Patterns**
- Regional URLs (shop-vn.tiktok.com) often redirect to homepage
- Solution: URL normalization to generic format with regional parameters
- Geo-location spoofing implementation for market-specific content

### Anti-Detection Measures
- Realistic browser fingerprinting
- Random user agent rotation
- Appropriate request timing and delays
- Regional timezone and locale configuration

### Multi-Language Data Processing

The extraction system handles content in multiple languages:
- **English**: Standard product specifications and reviews
- **Vietnamese**: Localized content for Vietnam market
- **Arabic**: Right-to-left text support for Saudi Arabia market
- **Spanish**: Additional language support for broader coverage

## File Structure

```
scraper_output_final_max/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tiktok_products_reviews_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.csv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page_content_url1_attempt_1_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ page_content_url2_attempt_1_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.html
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ...
```

### CSV Output Format

## Customization

### Search Queries
```python
# Examples of effective search queries
queries = [
    "Lanc√¥me products TikTok shop Vietnam",
    "skincare TikTok shop Saudi Arabia",
    "electronics TikTok shop"
]
```

### Region Priorities
Modify the `regions_to_try` list to prioritize different regions:
```python
regions_to_try = ['VN', 'SA', 'US']  # Vietnam first, then Saudi Arabia, then US
```

### Adding New Regions
Add new geo-configurations in the `geo_configs` dictionary:
```python
'DE': {
    'timezone': 'Europe/Berlin',
    'locale': 'de-DE',
    'geolocation': {'latitude': 52.5200, 'longitude': 13.4050},
    # ... other settings
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Captcha Problems**:
   - Ensure `headless=False` for manual captcha solving
   - Wait for page to fully load before solving
   - Some captchas may require multiple attempts

2. **Region Blocking**:
   - Script automatically tries multiple regions
   - VN and SA regions often have better access
   - Some products may not be available in certain regions

3. **API Limits**:
   - Firecrawl free tier has usage limits
   - Create new account or upgrade for higher limits
   - Check API key validity

4. **Scraping Failures**:
   - Increase timeout values for slow connections
   - Check internet connection stability
   - Some URLs may be temporarily unavailable

### Error Messages

- `"Region blocked"`: Product not available in that region
- `"Captcha detected"`: Manual intervention required
- `"HTTP 403/429"`: Rate limiting or access denied
- `"No TikTok Shop URLs discovered"`: Search query needs refinement

## Performance Metrics

- **Speed**: 2-5 URLs per minute (depending on captchas)
- **Success Rate**: ~70-80% (varies by region and time)
- **Data Quality**: High accuracy with manual verification possible
- **Scalability**: Suitable for small to medium datasets (10-100 URLs)

## Future Improvements

### Automation Enhancements
- Integration with automated CAPTCHA solving services
